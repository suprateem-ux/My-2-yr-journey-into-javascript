# 🚀 My 2-Year Journey into JavaScript

Welcome to my **JavaScript adventure**! 🎉  
Over the past 2 years, I’ve built a bunch of fun and interactive projects using **Game Lab of code.org, App lab of code.org, and pure JavaScript**. You can **play, explore, and learn** from them directly on GitHub Pages! 🌐.
